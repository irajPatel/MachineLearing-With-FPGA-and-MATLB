# MachineLearing-With-FPGA-and-MATLB
n this project, I implemented linear regression and deep neural networks using Simulink and HDL Coder in MATLAB, generating HDL code for FPGA deployment on a Nexys 4 Artix-7 board. The goal was to explore hardware acceleration for efficient, real-time processing


## Linear Regression

**Understanding Linear Regression**

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x1, x2, ..., xn). It assumes that the relationship can be represented by a linear equation:

```
y = θ0 + θ1x1 + θ2x2 + ... + θnxn
```

where:

* θ0 is the intercept term (bias or offset)
* θ1, θ2, ..., θn are the coefficients representing the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable

**Vector Notation**

The equation can also be expressed in vector notation:

```
y = θ^T x
```

where:

* θ is a column vector of coefficients (θ0, θ1, ..., θn)
* x is a column vector of independent variables (1, x1, x2, ..., xn)
* ^T denotes the transpose

**Finding the Optimal Parameters (θ)**

The goal is to find the best values for θ that minimize the difference between predicted values (ŷ) and actual values (y). This is typically done using the squared error loss function:

```
L(ŷ(x; θ), y) = (ŷ(x; θ) - y)^2
```

The cost function is the average of the loss function over all data points:

```
J(θ) = 1/n * Σ(L(ŷ(xi; θ), yi))
```

Using linear algebra, the solution for the optimal parameter vector θ is:

```
θ̂ = (X^TX)^-1 X^Ty
```

where:

* X is the matrix of independent variables (design matrix)
* y is the vector of dependent variables

**Steps Involved:**

1. **Collect data:** Gather a dataset with the dependent and independent variables.
2. **Prepare data:** Clean, preprocess, and possibly normalize the data.
3. **Create the design matrix:** Construct the matrix X by including the independent variables and an extra column of 1s for the intercept term.
4. **Calculate the optimal parameters:** Use the equation θ̂ = (X^TX)^-1 X^Ty to compute the coefficients.
5. **Make predictions:** Use the trained model (with the estimated coefficients) to predict the dependent variable for new input data.

**Key Points:**

* Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables.
* The squared error loss function is commonly used to measure the model's performance.
* The optimal parameters can be found using linear algebra.
* The model can be used for prediction and understanding the relationship between variables.
