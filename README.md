# MachineLearing-With-FPGA-and-MATLB
n this project, I implemented linear regression and deep neural networks using Simulink and HDL Coder in MATLAB, generating HDL code for FPGA deployment on a Nexys 4 Artix-7 board. The goal was to explore hardware acceleration for efficient, real-time processing
