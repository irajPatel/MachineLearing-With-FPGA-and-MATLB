# Machine Learning with FPGA and MATLAB

## Project Overview

This project explores hardware acceleration for machine learning models using FPGA for efficient, real-time processing. We implemented **Linear Regression** and **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)** using **Simulink** and **HDL Coder** in **MATLAB**, generating HDL code for deployment on the Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA board. The goal was to evaluate performance differences between software-based execution and FPGA-based hardware acceleration.

### Models Implemented
1. **Linear Regression**: Predicting house prices using the `USAHousing.data` dataset.
2. **Deep Neural Networks**: Implementing basic deep learning models for hardware acceleration.

## Linear Regression Implementation

### Steps:
1. **Simulink Model Creation**:  
   A Simulink model was built to simulate the behavior of a Linear Regression model. The model was designed to compute the regression coefficients (θ) using the dataset.  
   **Equation**:  
   \[
   \hat{y} = X\theta
   \]  
   where `X` is the input data and `θ` represents the coefficients.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   After computing the coefficients, the input data and coefficients were converted into **fixed-point** values using the custom function `ConvertToFixedPoint()`. This step is necessary to align the data with FPGA's fixed-point operations.

3. **Simulink Simulation**:  
   The fixed-point variables were loaded directly from the MATLAB workspace into Simulink. The model output was compared with MATLAB’s simulation results and hardware outputs on the FPGA.

### HDL Code Generation and Deployment

#### Steps:
1. **Generating HDL Files**:
   - Ensure you have the required add-ons in MATLAB, including **HDL Coder** and **Fixed-Point Designer**.
   - Use the following commands to generate the HDL files:
     ```matlab
     checkhdl(<Simulink_Model_Name>)
     createhdl(<Simulink_Model_Name>)
     ```

2. **FilWizard Command**:  
   Run the `filwizard` command in MATLAB to set up the FPGA board configuration.
   ```matlab
   filwizard
   ```
   - Select the Nexys 4 Artix-7 board.
   - Make your module the top module in the HDL code.

3. **Build and Upload**:  
   Build the project and upload the generated HDL code onto the FPGA board.

4. **Testing and Comparison**:  
   - Connect the FPGA board to Simulink using the generated module.
   - Use a **Scope** block to compare the hardware output with the MATLAB and Simulink simulation outputs.

## Requirements

### MATLAB Toolboxes/Add-Ons:
- **Simulink**
- **HDL Coder**
- **Fixed-Point Designer**
- **MATLAB Coder**

### FPGA:
- Nexys 4 Artix-7 FPGA board (or similar)

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and load the Simulink model for Linear Regression or DNN.
3. Run the `ConvertToFixedPoint()` function to process data.
4. Use `checkhdl` and `createhdl` to generate HDL files.
5. Run `filwizard` to set up the FPGA board and upload the HDL code.
6. Compare the outputs from FPGA, Simulink, and MATLAB to evaluate accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of using FPGAs to accelerate machine learning models like Linear Regression and Deep Neural Networks. By leveraging HDL Coder and Simulink, efficient hardware implementations were achieved, and comparisons were made between software and hardware outputs to verify accuracy and performance.
